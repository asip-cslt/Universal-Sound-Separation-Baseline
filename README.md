# Vocal-Separation-Baseline

A 4-mix vocal separation baseline based on [SpeechBrain](https://github.com/speechbrain/speechbrain) (using SepFormer & Conv-TasNet).


# Environment Setup
```bash
conda create -n sb_sep python=3.11 -y
conda activate sb_sep
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
# Pretrain Model

# Training




# Results
Below is a summary of the average separation performance for two models in XXX dataset.
Metrics include Scale-Invariant Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SI-SNR) and Signal-to-Distortion Ratio (SDR), along with their respective improvements (i).

| Model     | SI-SNR (dB) | SI-SNRi (dB) | SDR (dB) | SDRi (dB) |
| --------- | ----------- | ------------ | -------- | --------- |
| SepFormer |    âˆ’20.60   |     5.49     |  âˆ’4.60   |    4.62   |
| TasNet    |    âˆ’20.22   |     5.88     |  âˆ’4.17   |    5.06   |
