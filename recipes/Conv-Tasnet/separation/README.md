# Universal Sound Separation

* This recipe supports train with several source separation models, including [Sepformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.13154), [RE-SepFormer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.09507), [DPRNN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.06379), [ConvTasnet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.07454), [DPTNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.13975).

<!-- **Web Demo** Integrated to [Huggingface Spaces](https://huggingface.co/spaces) with [Gradio](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio). See demo Speech Separation: [![Hugging Face Spaces](https://img.shields.io/badge/%F0%9F%A4%97%20Hugging%20Face-Spaces-blue)](https://huggingface.co/spaces/akhaliq/speechbrain-speech-seperation) -->

<!-- ## Installing Extra Dependencies

Before proceeding, ensure you have installed the necessary additional dependencies. To do this, simply run the following command in your terminal:

```
pip install -r ../extra_requirements.txt
``` -->

## How to run
To run it:

```shell
python train.py hyperparams/sepformer.yaml --data_folder yourpath/data
```
Note that during training we print the negative SI-SNR (as we treat this value as the loss).

# How to run on test sets only
If you want to run it on the test sets only, you can add the flag `--test_only` to the following command:

```shell
python train.py hyperparams/sepformer.yaml --data_folder yourpath/data --test_only
```
<!-- # WSJ0-2mix and WSJ0-3mix dataset creation
* The best way to create the datasets is using the original matlab script. This script and the associated meta data can be obtained through the following [link](https://www.dropbox.com/s/gg524noqvfm1t7e/create_mixtures_wsj023mix.zip?dl=1).
* The dataset creation script assumes that the original WSJ0 files in the sphere format are already converted to .wav . -->


# Dynamic Mixing:

* This recipe supports dynamic mixing where the training data is dynamically created in order to obtain new utterance combinations during training. For this you need to have the WSJ0 dataset (available though LDC at `https://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC93S6A`).



# Multi-GPU training

You can run the following command to train the model using Distributed Data Parallel (DDP) with 2 GPUs:

```bash
torchrun --nproc_per_node=2 train.py hparams/sepformer.yaml --data_folder yourpath/data
```
You can add the other runtime options as appropriate. For more complete information on multi-GPU usage, take a look at [our documentation](https://speechbrain.readthedocs.io/en/latest/multigpu.html).
